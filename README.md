# Module2

## Description

I am proud of this page because I started from scratch and decided to build this without a starter code. I did this because I wanted to increase my understanding of HTML and CSS and I wanted to see each component that I added to the as it was added in real time. 

There were moments where I felt very frustrated during this project, but the moments of frustration and the moments when I discovered the solution were key learning moments this week. 

Please ignore the stand alone files "# reset" and "# style" that was an embarassing part of my learning journey. 

## Credits

I leaned heavily on google often looking up questions like "How do I make the image shift to the right." Hashtag very thankful that someone invented the internet.
