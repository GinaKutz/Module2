# Module2
## Description
I am proud of this page because I started from scratch and decided to build this without a starter code. I did this because I wanted to increase my understanding of HTML and CSS and I wanted to see each component that I added to the as it was added in real time. 

There were moments where I felt very frustrated during this project, but the moments of frustration and the moments when I discovered the solution were key learning moments this week. 

Adding a grid was very challenging for me as it messed up my CSS that I had worked on up to that point.

I also originally made an error in creating my files. I feel I learned a lot about how Git Hub interacts with VS Code in this assignment.

## Credits
I leaned heavily on google often looking up questions like "How do I make the image shift to the right." Hashtag very thankful that someone invented the internet.
